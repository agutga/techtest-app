Wunderdogs tech test APP (Front-end)

Shows a list of links composed by LinkUrl, LinkShortenedUrl and Creation date.

Each time there's a click in a shortened url, it stores a link event and redirects to the actual link url.

It's possible to check link click event statistics by clicking "See statistics button" next to the link in the list.

Also it's possible to delete a link (and its link events if they exist).
